              <p>As a Competitive Powerlifter primarily lifting using pounds, the conversion between kilograms and pounds can be tedious. As a solution,
                the idea for an automatic conversion 'Powerlifting Calculator' came to mind. This was more than suitable for my first attempt at an application
                which ended up successful. Throughout the process, I became familiar with Android Studio, User-Interface design for applications, and deployment
                of applications to an 'app store'. My GitHub repository linked below contains the source code for the application and a direct link to the Google

                  Structures, Discrete Structures of Computer Science, and Machine Architecture and Organization. As a teaching assistant, I helped refine and write labs
                  and projects that were to be assigned to students. Along with three fellow teaching assistants, we ran a lab of 30-40 students where students would work
                  on problems to advance the required knowledge of the course. On rotation, I would lead the lab myself where I would speak in front of the lab at start time
                  to give a concise introduction to what would be required in the lab. Outside of labs, I held office hours where students would come for help on class material,
                  projects, assignments, or whatever else they needed assistance with. On numerous occassions, I was given personal Thank-Yous from students that felt I had made
                  a difference in their learning. To assist the professor, the teaching assistants would help grade projects, assignments, tests, or whatever was assigned to
                  the students.

                <p>
                  As someone who grew up playing soccer and loves to teach and help others, I was introduced to the National Sports Center's opportunity to be a soccer coach. Each
                  summer, I would be given a team of kids aged 4-5 or 5-8. I would lead the kids in different activities and games to provide a fun learning environment, so the kids
                  had the opportunity to experience a team-oriented sport in an exciting atmosphere. I was recommended by many of the parents and personally asked to continue being
                  the kids coach for future sessions numerous times throughout the years.

                <h1>The Home Depot</h1>
                <p>
                  I was hired as a cashier for my local Home Depot where I provided excellent customer support and security on the front-end of the store. I had the responsibilities of
                  handling cash registers, working directly with customers to fulfill their needs, and ensure the security of the front-end when patrons left the store. I was successfully
                  able to de-escalate situations where conflict occurred and was able to protect the stock of the store on multiple different occassions. As the last face the customer would
                  see before leaving our store, I provided a friendly face with quick checkout and ensured the customers left the store feeling better than when they came in.
